## Overview  
Maslo Companion Server is a set of signal processing APIs for numerous types of data  
  
Response formats: JSON  
Requires Authentication? Yes (user context only)  
Rate limited? Yes  
Request Formats: Requests should be either multipart/form-data or application/x-www-form-urlencoded or application/json POST formats  
  
## AnalyzeMedia  
**Purpose:** AnalyzeMedia accepts media files (currently images) and returns detailed signal analysis on the image quality, subject matter, scenic context, human subject pose/sentiment/emotion, etc.  

API endpoint: /analyzeMedia  POST  

### Request:  
| Field Name | Required? | Description | Example | Notes |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ------- | ----- |
| media | Required | Raw binary of file to be uploaded.  Can include multiple, each to be analyzed individually. |  | max size = 30MB/file, max 50 files per payload.  Limited to image files currently |
| type | required | Type of media, as a backstop for mimetype detection problems.  values: image, video, audio. | "image" |  |
| originMediaID |  | originMediaID to be passed back in response. (GUID) | 062fea4d-efdd-4a7f-92b1-4039503efd5b | GUID or INT |

**Sample cURL Post:**  
```javascript

curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/analyzeMedia' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \

## AnalyzeText  
**Purpose:** AnalyzeText accepts text samples and returns detailed signal analysis on tone/sentiment and grammar and vocabulary sophistication.


API endpoint: /analyzeText  POST  

### Request:  
| Field Name | Required? | Description | Example | Notes |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ------- | ----- |
| text | required | Raw text to be analyzed |  |  |
